This project is a practice app used for a coding challenge.

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as its base, specifically using the react-ts template.

This project also uses:
- [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/)

To start this app you should:
`npm i`
then
`npm start` (or `npm run dev`)

This was done in about 2-3 hours as a test run of Vite. The major component is `TypingGame.tsx`.
